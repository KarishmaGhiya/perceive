The required R packages (rvest, magrittr & gsubfn) are installed on the host computer.

For this script capec_v2.8.xml was user, In case there is a newer version available on the CAPEC website please download it into the same folder as the script and change line number 7 to the new filename.

In Line 9 of the code, we are filtering the xml nodes that are only of the type 'Attack Pattern' hence extracting data only for the required fields.
