The scraper script needs downloaded CWE data in XML format. 
There is no need to change or set any parameters, just install the required packages and run the script as is. 
There are 3 outputs from the script:
  1. Weakness_Data.csv : Contains all extracted data from the XML file
  2. Nodelist.csv : Contains the nodelist 
  3. Edgelist.csv : Contains the edgelist
