The cybersecurity community typically reacts to attacks after they occur. Being reactive is costly and can be fatal where attacks threaten lives, important data, or mission success. But can cybersecurity be done proactively?

# Our Group 

We are currently prototyping some tools to investigate how far ahead we can identify upcoming threats, using social network analysis and text mining.
